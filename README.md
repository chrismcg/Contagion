CRM Virus Control
=================

Most importantly, this is *nowhere* near ready for primetime yet. Development
has just started so don't expect anything to work :)

Uses Leigh Hunt's [lh\_midiinout][1] to get the midi from the virus before Live
can strip out the SySex/Poly Aftertouch.

Plan is to make the first version open in it's own window and show you *every*
control. This is to make it easier for me to figure out what makes a preset
tick etc. If time and my max abilities allow I'll make a "slim" version that
fits in abletons device strip and shows only important controls, maybe even
tabbed.

Going to make work with my Virus B first, then see what needs to be done for
other versions.
