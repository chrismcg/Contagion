Contagion
=========

A Max for Live controller for older versions of the Access Virus. B inititally
as that's what I have to develop / test with.

Most importantly, this is *nowhere* near ready for primetime yet. Development
has just started so don't expect anything to work :)

Uses Leigh Hunt's
[lh\_midiinout](http://web.mac.com/leighhunt/iWeb/Site/downloads.html) to get
the midi from the virus before Live can strip out the SySex/Poly Aftertouch.

Original plan was to make the first version open in it's own window and show
you *every* control. This was to make it easier for me to figure out what makes
a preset tick etc. Sketching this out I realised there's really too much to
show on one screen. So I'm of two minds at the moment. The current idea is to
make something similar to the actual Ti Virus Control i.e. Popup and tabbed. I
haven't completely ruled out making something very tabbed that will fit in the
Live device window though.
